# Politicz

Politicz is a Python class that simulates a game in which the user makes decisions as a political leader and the values of certain variables (GDP, health, education, unemployment, crime, poverty, and foreign relations) change as a result. The code provides methods to present dilemmas, handle user's choices, print the current variables' state, and check the game's end condition.
